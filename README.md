# 🎨 Frontend Mentor Challenge Solutions

> _A growing gallery of small builds, UI glow-ups, and code experiments._

Welcome to my collection of **Frontend Mentor** and similar front-end challenges!  
Each folder includes a live demo (or CodePen link) and the full source code — all built from scratch, sometimes extended well beyond the base challenge specs 😎

## 🧩 What You'll Find Here

- 🔹 **Beginner → Advanced challenges** rewritten or restyled with flair
- 🔹 **Speed-build** style experiments (often featured on my YouTube: [@PictureThisCoding](https://www.youtube.com/@PictureThisCoding))
- 🔹 Fun uses of animations, gradients, and pseudo-elements
- 🔹 A touch of over-engineering, because why not

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript (Vanilla)**
- Occasional use of:
  - 🧠 `fetch()` API for dummy data
  - ✨ CSS `@property` and `conic-gradient()` tricks
  - ⚡ Frontend Mentor & CodePen environments

## 🧠 Philosophy

> “Plain text ➜ Finished design.”

This repo exists to show the **process of transforming basic HTML into polished UI**, one component at a time — a place to practice design thinking, animation logic, and small project structure.

Quick builds • satisfying visuals • short edits.

## 🪄 Future Plans

- More interactive components (carousels, loaders, 3D effects)
- “Extended Challenge” series — taking beginner layouts to full mini-apps
- Possibly… a live-coded challenge stream 👀
